> Exercise 1

Pair with Target Sum
Problem Statement
Given an array of numbers sorted in ascending order and a target sum, find a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given target.

Write a function to return the indices of the two numbers (i.e. the pair) such that they add up to the given target.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6], target=6
Output: [1, 3]
Explanation: The numbers at index 1 and 3 add up to 6: 2+4=6
Example 2:

Input: [2, 5, 9, 11], target=11
Output: [0, 2]
Explanation: The numbers at index 0 and 2 add up to 11: 2+9=11

> Exercise 2

Dutch National Flag Problem (medium)
Problem Statement
Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should treat numbers of the array as objects, 
hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; and since our input array also 
consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
Output: [0 0 1 1 2]
Example 2:

Input: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
Output: [0 0 1 2 2 2 ]

> Exercise 3

Given an array arr of unsorted numbers and a target sum, count all triplets in it such that arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] < target 
where i, j, and k are three different indices. Write a function to return the count of such triplets.

Example 1:

Input: [-1, 0, 2, 3], target=3 
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two triplets whose sum is less than the target: [-1, 0, 3], [-1, 0, 2]
Example 2:

Input: [-1, 4, 2, 1, 3], target=5 
Output: 4
Explanation: There are four triplets whose sum is less than the target: [-1, 4, 1],[-1, 2, 1],[-1, 1, 3],[ -1, 2, 3]

> Exercise 3

Given a 2D array (i.e., a matrix) containing only 1s (land) and 0s (water), count the number of islands in it.

An island is a connected set of 1s (land) and is surrounded by either an edge or 0s (water). 
Each cell is considered connected to other cells horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).

> Exercise 4
Given a list of intervals, merge all the overlapping intervals to produce a list that has only mutually exclusive intervals.

Example 1:
Intervals: [[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]]
Output: [[1,5], [7,9]]
Explanation: Since the first two intervals [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, we merged them into 
one [1,5].

Example 2:
Intervals: [[6,7], [2,4], [5,9]]
Output: [[2,4], [5,9]]
Explanation: Since the intervals [6,7] and [5,9] overlap, we merged them into one [5,9].

Example 3:
Intervals: [[1,4], [2,6], [3,5]]
Output: [[1,6]]
