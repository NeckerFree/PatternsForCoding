Pair with Target Sum
Problem Statement
Given an array of numbers sorted in ascending order and a target sum, find a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given target.

Write a function to return the indices of the two numbers (i.e. the pair) such that they add up to the given target.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6], target=6
Output: [1, 3]
Explanation: The numbers at index 1 and 3 add up to 6: 2+4=6
Example 2:

Input: [2, 5, 9, 11], target=11
Output: [0, 2]
Explanation: The numbers at index 0 and 2 add up to 11: 2+9=11

> Exercise 2

Dutch National Flag Problem (medium)
Problem Statement
Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should treat numbers of the array as objects, 
hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; and since our input array also 
consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
Output: [0 0 1 1 2]
Example 2:

Input: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
Output: [0 0 1 2 2 2 ]
